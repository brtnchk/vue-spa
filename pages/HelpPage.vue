      <p class="mb-4 text">We'd been keeping Memscore a secret, but a lucky few got to try it in advance. Here's what some of them had to say:
</p>


<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">What is Memscore?</b>

Memscore is a website that can help you learn and memorize anything you want. Study content created by other subscribers or create your own notes and courses.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">How can I get started on Memscore?</b>

A good way to get started on Memscore after creating an account is to simply upload the materials you are studying onto the site. Alternatively, you can search for notes and courses made by other subscribers.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">How can students use Memscore?</b>

Students can use Memscore’s study feature to develop foundational knowledge of a subject. Once they acquire that basic mastery, they can then engage in more complex activities like discussions, which can be highly rewarding.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">How can teachers use Memscore?</b>

Teachers looking to use Memscore with their students can apply it to their classroom in a variety of ways. For example, teachers can have their students study on Memscore to increase comprehension of prose, learn from worked examples, and practice retrieval. In addition, we plan to release a “Class” function that will allow teachers to communicate with and monitor the performance of students in their Memscore class.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">Can I use Memscore on a mobile device?</b>

We recognize that many people want to study with Memscore on their mobile devices, and we are working on developing iOS and Android apps.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">How exactly is Memscore supported by science?</b>

Since Memscore was very recently created, there are no scientific studies that have been published in a peer-reviewed journal on it. However, the cognitive principles that Memscore is based on have been extensively researched and discussed by the scientific community for almost a century, and cognitive psychologists have given clear recommendations on how to apply and use them. That's why we're confident that Memscore is capable of helping all learners.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">Have you conducted any studies on Memscore?</b>

Yes, the Memscore team has conducted many tests to evaluate the efficacy of Memscore. In fact, the founder of Memscore has used it for about 1 hour every day for the past four months to study law, memorize fiction, and practice writing. Others have used it as well, though for not as long, and the results have been universally positive.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">Can Memscore really help me study 4x faster?</b>

Studies done by the Memscore team show that this is possible. We have observed that due to the limited capacity of working memory, once the amount of information to-be-memorized exceeds about 100 words, people can memorize 4x faster with Memscore than when they memorize without it. However, in the interest of full disclosure, our claim that Memscore can increase study efficiency by 300% is based only on the studies we personally conducted.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">Where can I learn more about the science of learning?</b>

We recommend reading "Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning" by Peter Brown, Dr. Roediger, and Dr. McDaniel. It has been cited many times and is the #1 Best Seller in Study & Test-Taking Skills according to Amazon.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 text">
  <b class="d-block">How can I help Memscore grow?</b>

You can help Memscore accomplish its mission of improving educational outcomes for everyone by sharing Memscore with others!
